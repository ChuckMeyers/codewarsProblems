// Since we cannot define keywords in Javascript (well, at least I don't know how to do it), 
// your task is to define a function xor(a, b) where a and b are the two expressions to be evaluated. 
// Your xor function should have the behaviour described above, returning true if exactly one of the two expressions evaluate to true, false otherwise.

// Solution

const xor = (a,b) => a!=b;
