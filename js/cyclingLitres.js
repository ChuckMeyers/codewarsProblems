// Nathan loves cycling.
// Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
// You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

// Solution

const litres = time => Math.floor(time/2);
